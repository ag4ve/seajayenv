# Environmental Consulting

## Fort Irwin Flora Planning Level Surveys 

SeaJay Environmental is providing safety and botanical support services to 
RJRudy LLC during field surveys at the U.S. Army's National Training Center,
Fort Irwin, CA. The works consists of daily safety briefings then general 
flora and threatened and endangered species plant surveys within 284 
one-hectare plots, 11 springs, 10 playas, and approximately 30 additional 
areas of interest on the base. Voucher specimens are also being collected.

## San Francisco Estuary Institute 

Carliane Johnson with SeaJay Environmental led a water quality monitoring team
in the collection of watershed samples. The work was part of the James V. 
Fitzgerald Project Area of Special Biological Significance Pollution Reduction
Program. The data were used to evaluate differences in contaminant concentrations 
from stormwater discharges into this marine reserve, which is recognized as one
of the richest, most biodiverse intertidal environments on the California coast.
 
## Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS)

SeaJay Environmental provided contract staff support to the sanctuary. Responsibilities
included reviewing applications and issuing permits for research, education and salvage
activities proposed in GFNMS, as well as in the northern area of Monterey Bay National
Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS). Other activities included responding to vessel grounding 
incidents and overseeing the White Shark Stewardship Program. During the course of the
work, two environmental assessments (EAs) were prepared. One was related to impacts
associated with white shark research and tourism. The other was to assess
impacts from U.S. Coast Guard live fire training discharges in the sanctuaries. The work
involved careful public records administration, such as tracking of comments received, 
compiling citations used, and documenting all communications with stakeholders, other state
and federal agency staffs, and the permit applicants. Support to GFNMS legal counsel was 
also provided during several permit appeals. Other project work included assisting the GFNMS
office in its documentation of and discussions with U.S. Coast Guard to consider realigning
the commercial vessel traffic separation lanes offshore San Francisco. This effort led to
the International Maritime Organization to amend the San Francisco Traffic Separation Scheme
to enhance navigational safety and mitigate the co-occurrence of endangered marine species
with commercial vessel traffic.
 
## National Marine Fisheries Service Office of Protected Resources. 

SeaJay Environmental staff created a SQL database to support and analyze
Automatic Information System (AIS) data that were used to assess the effectiveness
of a rule requiring vessels 65 feet and longer in length to slow their speeds to 
10 knots or less near key port entrances along the U.S. Eastern seaboard and in 
certain North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) aggregation sites known
as Seasonal Management Areas. Monthly reports were sent to seventeen international
shipping companies to help them ensure compliance of United States law within their fleets.

lines.
