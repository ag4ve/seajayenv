# Environmental Consulting

## Fort Irwin Flora Planning Level Surveys 

SeaJay Environmental is providing safety and botanical support services to 
RJRudy LLC during field surveys at the U.S. Army's National Training Center,
Fort Irwin, CA. The works consists of daily safety briefings followed by field surveys 
conducting general flora and threatened and endangered species plant transects within 284 
one-hectare plots, 11 springs, 10 playas, and approximately 30 additional 
areas of interest on the base. Voucher specimens are also being collected.

## San Francisco Estuary Institute 

Carliane Johnson with SeaJay Environmental led a water quality monitoring team
in the collection of watershed samples that was part of the James V. 
Fitzgerald Project Area of Special Biological Significance Pollution Reduction
Program. The data were used to evaluate differences in contaminant concentrations 
from stormwater discharges into this marine reserve, which is recognized as one
of the richest, most biodiverse intertidal environments on the California coast.
 
## Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS)

SeaJay Environmental provided contract staff support to the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS). 
Responsibilities included reviewing applications and issuing permits for proposed research, education and salvage
activities in GFNMS, as well as in the northern area of Monterey Bay National
Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS). Other activities included responding to vessel grounding 
incidents and overseeing the White Shark Stewardship Program. During the course of the
work, two environmental assessments (EAs) were prepared. One was a programmatic EA related to impacts
associated with white shark research and tourism. The other EA was to assess
water quality imapcts from U.S. Coast Guard live fire training discharges in GFNMS and Cordell Bank National 
Marine Sanctuary. The work involved careful public records administration, such as tracking of public comments, 
compiling the administrative record, and documenting all communications with stakeholders, other state
and federal agency staffs, and permit applicants. Support to GFNMS legal counsel was 
also provided during several permit appeals. Other project work included assisting the GFNMS
office in its documentation of and discussions with U.S. Coast Guard to consider realigning
the commercial vessel traffic separation lanes offshore San Francisco. This effort led to
the International Maritime Organization to amend the San Francisco Traffic Separation Scheme
to enhance navigational safety and mitigate the co-occurrence of endangered marine species
with commercial vessel traffic.
 
## National Marine Fisheries Service Office of Protected Resources. 

SeaJay Environmental staff created a SQL database to support and analyze
Automatic Information System (AIS) data that were then used to assess the effectiveness
of a rule requiring vessels 65 feet and longer in length to slow their speeds to 
10 knots or less near key port entrances along the U.S. Eastern seaboard and in 
certain North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) aggregation sites known
as Seasonal Management Areas. Monthly reports were also sent to seventeen international
shipping companies to help them ensure compliance of United States law within their fleets.

## Smithsonian Environmental Research Center

Carliane Johnson with SeaJay Environmental provided dive support services
for an invasive species survey in the kelp forests between Monterey and Carmel, 
California, and within the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. She identified 
invasive species (primarily Watersipora) in 1-meter quadrats along 25-meter transect
lines.

## Half Moon Bay Yacht Club Biological Assessment

SeaJay Environmental conducted a biological assessment of the water and land
resources surrounding the Half Moon Bay Yacht Club related to a proposed 
floating dock and pier for a California Coastal Development permit.

evacuation assets, practices, and available procedures in federal waters 
of the Gulf of Mexico. This resulted in a workshop report on best management practices and gaps. 
Another workshop was organized on sandblasting and surface coating operations in the marine environment, which 
was intended to obtain best management practices from offshore operators and their 
contractors related to procedures used to minimize the discharge of spent 
blast abrasives and paint overspray in the Gulf of Mexico.
