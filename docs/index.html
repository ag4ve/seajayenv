specializes in analyzing energy and environmental policies, providing
regulatory compliance support, preparing environmental impact assessments,
storm water monitoring, pollution prevention planning, stakeholder
engagements, workshop facilitation, and other direct project management

<h1 id="environmental-consulting">Environmental Consulting</h1>

<h2 id="san-francisco-estuary-institute">San Francisco Estuary Institute</h2>

<p>Led a water quality monitoring team to collect watershed samples as part
of the James V. Fitzgerald Project Area of Special Biological Significance
Pollution Reduction Program. The data were used to evaluate differences in
contaminant concentrations from stormwater discharges into this marine
reserve. The reserve is recognized as one of the richest, most biodiverse
intertidal environments on the California coast.</p>

<h2 id="greater-farallones-national-marine-sanctuary">Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary</h2>

<p>Contractor to the sanctuary providing permitting support related to
proposed research, education and salvage projects. Also coordinating the
White Shark Stewardship Program, attending GFNMS and community meetings,
and assisting with other resource protection activities such as helping to
develop modifications to the San Francisco Traffic Separation Scheme and
responding to vessel groundings.</p>

<h2 id="national-marine-fisheries-service-office-of-protected-resources">National Marine Fisheries Service Office of Protected Resources.</h2>

<p>Created a SQL database to support and analyze Automatic Information System
(AIS) data that were used to assess the effectiveness of a rule requiring
vessels 65 feet and greater in length to slow their speeds to 10 knots or
less near key port entrances along the U.S. Eastern seaboard and in
certain North Atlantic right whale aggregation sites known as Seasonal
Management Areas. Monthly reports were also sent to seventeen international
shipping companies to help them ensure compliance of United States law
within their fleets.</p>

<h2 id="smithsonian-environmental-research-center">Smithsonian Environmental Research Center</h2>

<p>Provided dive support for an invasive species survey in the kelp forests
between Monterey and Carmel, California, and within the Monterey Bay
National Marine Sanctuary. Counted invasive species (primarily Watersipora)
in 1-meter quadrats along transect lines.</p>

<h2 id="shell-exploration-production-company">Shell Exploration &amp; Production Company</h2>

<p>On-call consultant providing regulatory support and conducting research on
various topics (e.g., marine sound, protected species, air and water
permitting, proposed federal regulations, artificial reefs) pertinent to
Shell’s domestic offshore oil and gas activities.</p>

<h2 id="offshore-operators-committee">Offshore Operators Committee</h2>

<p>Organized an industry workshop to better understand the scope of medical
evacuation assets, practices, and available procedures in federal waters
of the Gulf of Mexico. Then prepared the workshop report on best management
practices and gaps. Organized another workshop on sandblasting and surface
coating operations in the marine environment. The purpose of that workshop
was to obtain best management practices from offshore operators and their
contractors related to procedures used to minimize the discharge of spent
blast abrasives and paint overspray in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<h2 id="walsh-perú-s-a">Walsh Perú S.A.</h2>

<p>Prepared a regulatory document summarizing the applicable international
legal framework pertaining to the discharge of drill cuttings containing
non-aqueous drilling residues and issues related to the potential use of
thermal-treatment technology to clean those cuttings.</p>

<h2 id="o-brien-s-response-management">O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s Response Management</h2>

<p>Provided incident response support for the Enbridge pipeline spill in
Michigan. Evaluated proposed oil treatment options for environmental
effects on marsh and wetland habitats. Prepared standard operating
procedures for sediment curtains and gabion boxes; and for site
preparation, soil removal and disposal activities of contaminated
sediments. Also reviewed quality assurance plans.</p>
